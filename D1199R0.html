<h1>Can terse notation unify generic and object-oriented programming?</h1>
	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>C++ works best when compile-time and run-time programming are similar. For example, <tt>constexpr</tt> functions allow programs to easily move calculations back and forth between compile-time and run-time as circumstances dictate with no change in code. Similarly, terse notation has the potential to enable
		easily moving between template-based compile-time dispatch and OOP-based runtime-dispatch. We especially like this use case for terse
	notation because it requires a &ldquo;natural notation&rdquo; and cannot be accomplished with the long form concept notation.
		This paper analyzes how to support unification of generic and object-oriented programming 
		under a constrained declaration notation that builds on <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1141r0.html">P1141R0</a>.
	In the process, we provide what we believe to be a simple and comprehensive proposal for unifying generic and object-oriented programming.</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
	<p>It is well-known that generic programming and object-oriented programming can be applied to similar problems (See, for example, the discussion of containers in Bjarne Stroustrup's <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ralf.hinze/WG2.8/28/slides/bjarne.pdf">Concepts for C++1y: The Challenge</a>). While both object-oriented programming and generic programming are incredibly powerful at type-based dispatching, deciding which one to use can be difficult and is extremely
		committal once made. To us, the appeal of terse notation is that it has the potential to replace this often premature choice between two very different and poorly-integrated programming models for type-based dispatch with a well-integrated approach that allows the tradeoff between
		generic programming and object-oriented programming to be flexibly tuned and evolved over time as circumstances dictate.</p>
		 Let us consider the following declaration:
	
	<blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">bool is_convex(Shape const &amp;s) { /* ... */ }</pre></blockquote>
In C++17, this object-oriented code will use virtual methods in the <tt>Shape</tt> class to determine whether a shape is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set">convex</a>, but in the language of the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4674.pdf">Concepts TS</a>, this might equally well declare a function template
		performing compile-time dispatch between types satisfying the <tt>Shape</tt> concept. This suggests that it might 
		be possible to tune/evolve a program between object-oriented dispatch and maintaining the flexibility to  <tt>Shape</tt> to a Concept. If such a unification could be achieved, we believe it would be fantastically powerful, but of course the devil is in the details, so let us look more closely.
<h3>Challenges</h3>
One obvious challenge is that changing <tt>Shape</tt> from a
	concept to a class is very likely to break the function body for <tt>is_convex</tt> because, even though usage of classes and concepts are in some ways similar, there are many difference in their precise usage, both major and subtle, as illustrated below:
<blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">// The following is ok if Shape is a class but has numerous problems if Shape is a concept
bool is_convex(Shape const &amp;s) 
{
  pair&lt;Shape, int&gt; p(s, 7); 
  auto x = make_unique&lt;optional&lt;Shape&gt;&gt;(convex_hull(s));
  /* ... */
}
</pre></blockquote>
Likewise, even though the behavior of functions and function templates are also in some ways similar, their interpretation can change depending on
	whether <tt>Shape</tt> is a class or a concept:
<blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">// Pass by rvalue ref if Shape is a class, forwarding ref is Shape is a concept
bool smooth(Shape &amp;&amp;s);
auto f = &amp;smooth;  // OK if Shape is a class, but ill-formed if it is a concept
</pre></blockquote>
<h2>Proposal</h2>
So, how do we enable flexible code in the face of such distinctions without introducing breaking changes? Fortunately,
	the recent approach of P1141R0 gives us a sigil that can be used when we desire to say that type inference could take
	place.
	<blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">// is_convex is a function template
bool is_convex(Shape auto const &amp;s) { /* ... */ }</pre></blockquote>
	
P1141R0 defines what this means if <tt>Shape</tt> is a concept. To retain 
	flexibility as to whether <tt>Shape</tt> is a class or a concept, we merely
	need to provide a concepts-based interpretation of the above when <tt>Shape</tt>
	is a class, which is of course the concept that the type is simply <tt>Shape</tt>.
	More generally, we propose that <ul><li>a declaration that with an <tt>auto</tt>-qualified
	class <tt>C</tt>  the concept <tt>Same&lt;C, _ &gt;</tt> representing type
	equality with the class <tt>C</tt>.</ul>
In other words, if <tt>Shape</tt> is a class, the above declaration is equivalent
to
<blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">template&lt;typename T&gt; concept is_Shape = Same&lt;Shape, T&gt;;
bool is_convex(is_Shape auto const &amp;s);</pre></blockquote>
What about within the function body? Since we want to retain flexibility
as to whether <tt>C</tt> is a class or a concept, we add the following rule
<ul><li>Uses of <tt>Shape</tt> within the function body are all replaced by <tt>is_Shape</tt></li></ul>
This ensures that only code that is compatible with concepts is accepted, so that it is
easy to change <tt>Shape</tt> back and forth between being a class and a concept, completing the proposal.
